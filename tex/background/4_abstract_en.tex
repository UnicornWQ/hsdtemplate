\chapter[Abstract]{Abstract}
\begin{spacing}{1.5}
The main work is based on the existing Overleaf template——\href{https://cn.overleaf.com/latex/templates/shan-shi-da-xue-wei-lun-wen-mo-ban/cszgkzrnfkkr}{Shaanxi Division University Dissertation Template}, with minor repairs, a graduation thesis template for Henan Normal University graduate students (common to masters and Ph.D. students) based on Overleaf is provided.
In order to make it more convenient for everyone to use the template, this template basically comments on every piece of code, and optimizes the overall structure to make it easier to get started.
For the macro packages used, one or more reference web pages are also provided in the comments for everyone to quickly understand and use. I wish everyone a happy use! If you have any questions, please contact me: 846372951@qq.com.
